                        <p class="undertext">Kanban, a Japanese term meaning “billboard,” is a highly effective method
                            to visualize work, limit
                            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency or flow. <span class="font-strong">Join</span>
                            leverages the principles of
                            kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
