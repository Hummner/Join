                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <p><strong>Join</strong> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                    dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
                <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning “billboard,” is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency or flow. <strong>Join</strong> leverages the principles of
                    kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that <strong>Join</strong> is designed as an educational exercise and is not
                    intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,
                    we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality
                    regarding <strong>Join</strong>.</p>

                <h2>How to use it</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Exploring the Board</strong><br>When you log in to <strong>Join</strong>, you’ll find a
                        default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: “To Do”, “In
                        Progress”, “Await feedback” and “Done”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating Contacts</strong><br>To add people you want to collaborate on your projects, go
                        to the “Contacts” section, click on “New contact”, and fill in the required contact information.
                        Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                        board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adding Cards</strong><br>Now that you’ve added your contacts, you can start adding
                        cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the “+” button under the appropriate list to
                        create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                        assignees, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moving Cards</strong><br>Cards can be dragged and dropped between lists to reflect their
                        current status.</li>
                </ol>
