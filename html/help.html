                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <p><strong class="font-strong">Join</strong> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
                    dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
                <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning “billboard,” is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency or flow. <strong class="font-strong">Join</strong> leverages the principles of
                    kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that <strong class="font-strong">Join</strong> is designed as an educational exercise and is not
                    intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,
                    we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality
                    regarding <strong class="font-strong">Join</strong>.</p>

                <h2>How to use it</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Exploring the Board</strong><br>When you log in to <strong class="font-strong">Join</strong>, you’ll find a
                        default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: “To Do”, “In
                        Progress”, “Await feedback” and “Done”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating Contacts</strong><br>To add people you want to collaborate on your projects, go
                        to the “Contacts” section, click on “New contact”, and fill in the required contact information.
                        Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                        board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adding Cards</strong><br>Now that you’ve added your contacts, you can start adding
                        cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the “+” button under the appropriate list to
                        create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                        assignees, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moving Cards</strong><br>
                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from
                    one list to another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deleting Cards</strong><br>
                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently
                    remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                    Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the
                    current state of your project.
